You like how I live
My sauce way too drippy
You like how I
My sauce way too drippy (You like how I)
Live life how I live it
My sauce way too drippy
Drip

Live life how I live it
My sauce way too drippy
Whip it how I whip it
My sauce way too drippy
Drippy, drippy, drippy
I'm so drippy
Drippy, drippy, drippy
I'm so drip

Drip when I walk
I drip when I talk
Yep, you know I'm gone floss
Look, lil man is the boss
We livin' so large
Babe, what is your cause
No, I don't go to the malls
Pull up at ballroom, my shawty
Checks, run through checks, that's a check talkin'
Racks on top racks, that a racks talkin'
Boy you best get back before that bat talkin'
You better not talk bad, waitin' on that bag, talkin'
What that on my jean, you don't even know they name
That boy ain't on a scene, he don't even got no chain
Need that iced out ring, just to match my chain
When I hop off that plane, know I'm gone bring my gang
What is the mood today, we might just go to LA
No, you can't take my plate
No, you can't serve my weight
Player on my face, shawty ain't on my way
Got a party? I'm on my way
And I'm nutty, I'm on my way
Tell the money, I'm on my way
On the block we thirty day

Live life how I live it
My sauce way too drippy
Whip it how I whip it
My sauce way too drippy
Drippy, drippy, drippy
I'm so drippy
Drippy, drippy, drippy
I'm so drip
